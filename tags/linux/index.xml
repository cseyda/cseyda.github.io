      <description>Wired internet broke after floodings. To bridge the time till all repairs are finished I received a K4203 SurfStick. Some instructions how to get it to work and share the internet connection follows.
#K4203 SurfStick This stick provides a wireless internet connection through UMTS. In my case it didn&amp;rsquo;t work out of the box. Upon insertion in an USB slot it registered itself as a CD-reader. Apparently USB devices can have different modes of operation and change according to the situation.</description>

      <description>I recently started listening to podcasts. Intrigued by the usual promises of learning things, gaining perspectives and finding inspiration, there was luckily little friction in finding, getting and hearing them on linux. Only syncing to my mp3-player is a bit of a hassle.
What are podcasts, why should you listen to them and when? Podcasts are modern radio shows.
What internet videos/shows are to TV, podcasts are to radio shows.</description>
