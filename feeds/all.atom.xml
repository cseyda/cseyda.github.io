Wealth can be found elsewhere, too. A great property to also invest is you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following article I will outline the different currencies of investment, different options, and how they relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// ## Definitions: investment, currency
Definitions of investment oftentimes focus on the economic aspect&lt;a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/investing"&gt;^1&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;To commit (money or capital) in order to gain a financial return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking an investment is any commitment in order to gain something in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commitment ↔ currency ↔ future gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One form or currency of commitment is money. No doubts about that. Other forms can be seen as willpower, physical strength, etc. depending on your world views and line of work. But one form is universal, and that is time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On calculating the worth of an investment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A term often mentioned alongside investments is return of investment (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; calculates the relative gain from an investment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; = (gain from investment - cost of investment) / cost of investment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; greater 0 expresses an overall gain of investment, while a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; smaller 0 represents an overall loss. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; is often expressed as percentage&lt;a href="https://www.business-case-analysis.com/return-on-investment.html"&gt;^3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; is a simple metric, and should be adjusted to the individual needs, for example in conjunction with time intervals.
    Another way to figure out if an investment is good, is to calculate when it amortizes — when it returns its initial cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt;, as well as amortizing, loose value, if the expected return is hard to put in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying money to gain time results in the question, what time is worth to somebody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing money for knowledge? One could compare a future with or without a job, where this knowledge is needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using time to commit to a personal moral/ethic/… point of view? (For example searching and only buying vegan products). It’s personal, there is no objective way to determine its value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of traditional commitments and returns like time and money is relatively easy to determine. Personal, emotional and unreliable commitments and returns are hardly possible to estimate. Common sense, and in some cases (health) statistics are the only possibilities to judge such an investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currency exchange&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our definition of investment, and two forms of commitments / currencies, lets get the obvious out of the way, the conversions / exchanges between money, time and each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money ↔ money
Buying stocks, commodities, real estate, committing to startups, … &lt;a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/250194"&gt;^2&lt;/a&gt;, selling at higher value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time ↔ money
Doing work, getting paid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money ↔ time
Paying others doing work, having time doing something else instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time ↔ time
Using time for optimizing workflows, systems, doing more in shorter span of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no clear boundaries (for example doing research for the right financial investments uses time, whereas paying someone else uses money; or better workflows can yield money too), but the general understanding is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; can be used to evaluate if the investment is worthwhile, if an investment has an expected outcome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending 100€ to get 50€ back -&amp;gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; = (50 - 100) / 100 = -0.5 -&amp;gt; 50% loss, surely no good investment, while
spending 100€ to get 150€ back -&amp;gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; = (150 - 100) / 100 = 0.5 -&amp;gt; 50% win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to time. Investing 2 hours to reduce the time for a specific task from 4 to 1 minute seems not worthwhile if the task only runs once a week. It would need 40 weeks to amortize the investment.
    This changes drastically, if the task runs 3 times a day. The 2 hours invested will yield a positive return in just 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the more interesting, and sometimes overlooked investments.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="investment"></category></entry><entry><title>My article reading and consumption flow</title><link href="//cseyda.github.io/reading-flow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-17T00:00:00+02:00</published><author><name>Christian Seyda</name></author><id>tag:cseyda.github.io,2016-04-17:reading-flow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was overwhelmed. Articles in bookmarks, open tabs, tab groups, sometimes over different browsers and operating systems and even in my todo list … This had to to change. A process for reading was needed.
First step was to open even more tabs and add more bookmarks. But after some reading how others approach this topic, I got to work uncluttering this mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, the whole process is pretty obvious. It basically works this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articles come in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some are read, some are added to a read-later list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, articles from the read-later list are read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My implementation is a little more complex, because I added a research process and wanted to take more notes of what I learned (and because I am a complicated person?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting reading flow can be devided into different parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Documents and decisions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually all articles I read either come from the links gathered by looking something up in my browser, or though my feed reader (&lt;a href="https://inoreader.com"&gt;InoReader&lt;/a&gt;). These articles can be roughly divided into three types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News or otherweise short read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To-do or to-remember&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lenghty article&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short articles can be read as soon as I process them. It usually takes longer to store them for later, and often the relevant tidbit of story is contained in the headline and first paragraph. Unless I deem a short article save-worthy for later, it is read and closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A to-do or to-remember are for example dates I sould keep track of or articles/tutorials outlining some action. They are stored in my prefered todo-list application (&lt;a href="https://wunderlist.com"&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt;), with date or reminder as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lengthy articles, or topics I feel the urge to check out, are either read or stored, depending if I have the time and desire to readt them right now, or if they apply to the topic I check out. Temporary storage for worked on links are browser tabs (with the chrome extension &lt;a href="https://one-tab.com"&gt;OneTab&lt;/a&gt;), while other links I want to attend later are collected in a read-later service (&lt;a href="https://getpocket.com"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Actions and storage&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to process the tabs, read-later articles and todos. Todos are automatically processed as they come up, either with a reminder, or as next natural challenge on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the read-later articles I have regular time-slots. Some freshly brewed black coffee, and then I read what seems the most interessting. If the time is up, the remaining articles have to wait till next time. While reading I try to take notes of the interessting ideas/facts, so I can later recall what it was about. Processed articles are then stored in a bookmarking-service (&lt;a href="https://diigo.com"&gt;Diigo&lt;/a&gt;), together with the notes. Notes can also wander in my wiki, if they contribute or start a new topic worth keeping near me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabs are closed and used as the topic dictates. References/links and notes are written down in a wiki (&lt;a href="https://zim-wiki.org/"&gt;Zim&lt;/a&gt;). If the subject are worth a broader audience, I intend to write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fulltext article storage is something I contemplated about, but decided to be not worth the hassle. Diigo and &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in"&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; offer fulltext storage, there are solutions for Evernote, and storing locally as file is no problem at all, but I honestly have never really needed it. Just take (clear) enough notes, and consider the link as reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this overview is helpful for someone else. It surely has helped me a lot for a more streamlined reading experience, and therefore more time to read more :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popularity of social networks like Facebook and Twitter, together with media sharing plattforms like Flickr and the ubiquity of modern smart phones and cameras with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; sensors have lead to a vast amount of data with documents containing locations, text, and even more information. this data can be leveraged to optimise search results, perform targeted advertisement and even help people and authorities in case of nature catastrophes, for example as early warning systems. Geographic topic detection aims at providing meaningful topics for specific regions. One way to perform this task is to use a clustering algorithm with an appropriate distance function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis compares two such distance functions by performing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBSCAN&lt;/span&gt; and comparing the fount topics. A naive vector-based approach based on linear composition of a jaccard distance on a text vector, and a euclidean distance based on the location vector. The second approach uses a graph build with a Delaunay triangulation based on the location data, and additional nodes and edges based on the text data. A random walk method is then performed to determine the distances between points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important part is the quantitative evaluation of the found geographic topics with four standard cluster quality measures, and how well the scores from these measures resemble die actual quality of the topics. Used and evaluated datasets contain up to one million points, which is very much compared to other works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results show that both distance function are able to perform basic geographic topic discovery, but the graph-based approach usually outperforms the vector-based approach. Cluster quality measures, especially Silhouette width, give a general indication of the goodness of the performed topic discovery, but are unfortunately not suitable for direct comparison with the used base distances.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="publishing"></category></entry><entry><title>My bachelor’s thesis</title><link href="//cseyda.github.io/bachelor-thesis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-28T00:00:00+02:00</published><author><name>Christian Seyda</name></author><id>tag:cseyda.github.io,2011-03-28:bachelor-thesis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Estimation of Power Consumption of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVFS&lt;/span&gt;-Enabled Processors&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving energy is nowadays a critical factor, especially for data centers or high performance clusters which have a power consumption of several mega watts. The simple use of component energy saving mechanisms is not always possible, because this can lead to performance degradation. For this reason, high performance clusters are mainly not using them, even in low utilization phases. Modelling the power consumption of a component based on specific recordable values can help to find ways of saving energy or predicting the power consumption after replacing the component with a more efficient one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main power consumer on a recent system is the processor. This thesis presents a model of the power consumption of a processor based on its frequency and voltage. Comparisons with real world power consumption were done to evaluate the model. Furthermore a tracing library was extended to be able to log the processor frequency and idle states if available. Using the presented model and the trace files, a power estimator has been implemented being able to estimate the power consumption of the processor in the given trace file—or a more energy efficient processor—helping to motivate the usage of power saving mechanisms and energy efficient processors, and showing the long term potential for energy saving.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="publishing"></category></entry></feed>
