<p>It was too much. Articles in bookmarks, open tabs, tab groups, sometimes over different browsers and operating systems and even in my todo list &hellip; This had to to change. A process for reading was needed.
First step was to open even more tabs and add more bookmarks. But after some reading how others approach this topic, I got to work uncluttering this mess.</p>

<p>In hindsight, the whole process is pretty obvious. It basically works this way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Articles come in</li>
<li>Some are read, some are added to a read-later list</li>
<li>Later, articles from the read-later list are read</li>
</ol>

<p>My implementation is a little more complex, because I added a research process and wanted to take more notes of what I learned (and because I am a complicated person?).</p>

<p>The resulting reading flow can be devided into different parts:</p>

<h1 id="documents-and-decisions">Documents and decisions</h1>

<p>Usually all articles I read either come from the links gathered by looking something up in my browser, or though my feed reader (<a href="https://inoreader.com">InoReader</a>). These articles can be roughly divided into three types:</p>

<ol>
<li>News or otherweise short read</li>
<li>To-do or to-remember</li>
<li>Lenghty article</li>
</ol>

<p>Short articles can be read as soon as I process them. It usually takes longer to store them for later, and often the relevant tidbit of story is contained in the headline and first paragraph. Unless I deem a short article save-worthy for later, it is read and closed.</p>

<p>A to-do or to-remember are for example dates I sould keep track of or articles/tutorials outlining some action. They are stored in my prefered todo-list application (<a href="https://wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a>), with date or reminder as needed.</p>

<p>Lengthy articles, or topics I feel the urge to check out, are either read or stored, depending if I have the time and desire to readt them right now, or if they apply to the topic I check out. Temporary storage for worked on links are browser tabs (with the chrome extension <a href="https://one-tab.com">OneTab</a>), while other links I want to attend later are collected in a read-later service (<a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>).</p>

<h1 id="actions-and-storage">Actions and storage</h1>

<p>The next step is to process the tabs, read-later articles and todos. Todos are automatically processed as they come up, either with a reminder, or as next natural challenge on my list.</p>

<p>For the read-later articles I have regular time-slots. Some freshly brewed black coffee, and then I read what seems the most interessting. If the time is up, the remaining articles have to wait till next time. While reading I try to take notes of the interessting ideas/facts, so I can later recall what it was about. Processed articles are then stored in a bookmarking-service (<a href="https://diigo.com">Diigo</a>), together with the notes. Notes can also wander in my wiki, if they contribute or start a new topic worth keeping near me.</p>

<p>Tabs are closed and used as the topic dictates. References/links and notes are written down in a wiki (<a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim</a>). If the subject are worth a broader audience, I intend to write a blog post about it.</p>

<p>Fulltext article storage is something I contemplated about, but decided to be not worth the hassle. Diigo and <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> offer fulltext storage, there are solutions for Evernote, and storing locally as file is no problem at all, but I honestly have never really needed it. Just take (clear) enough notes, and consider the link as reference.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>I hope this overview is helpful for someone else. It surely has helped me a lot for a more streamlined reading experience, and therefore more time to read more :)</p>
